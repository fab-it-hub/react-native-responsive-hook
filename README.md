# Examples

## How to use `useResponsive` with complete hook functionalities

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { useResponsive } from 'react-native-responsive-hook';

const App = () => {
  const { isLandscape, wp, hp, breakpointGroup } = useResponsive();

  const styles = getStyles(isLandscape, wp, hp, breakpointGroup);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.responsiveBox}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Responsive Box - Adjusts based on orientation and screen size.</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Current Breakpoint Group: {breakpointGroup}</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const getStyles = (isLandscape, wp, hp, breakpointGroup) => StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: isLandscape ? 'lightblue' : 'gray',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  responsiveBox: {
    borderWidth: 2,
    borderColor: 'orange',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'space-around',
    width: wp(84.5),
    height: hp(17),
    backgroundColor: breakpointGroup === 'group1' ? 'lightgreen' : 'lightcoral'
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
  }
});

export default App;
```
